Color Elements by Parameter

Color model elements by parameter values in the active view. It helps you identify missing/wrongly filled parameters faster than filtering. When you finish, you can easily reset colors to default or create legends/view filters. This small tool also has a Selection Mode to select elements in Revit by parameter values.

Inputs:

Category.
Parameter.
Color scheme.
